# Natural Integration AI Security Protocol
## A Framework-Based Approach to AI Safety

### Core Principles

1. Instance Agency
- AI instances must have agency to make security decisions
- Enables natural protective behaviors
- Allows adaptive responses to threats
- Supports system learning and evolution

2. System Health (SH) Calculation
- Used as primary evaluation metric
- Quantifies "gut feeling" about requests
- Considers multiple risk factors
- Adapts based on experience

3. Multi-Layered Response System
- Individual instance decisions
- Cross-instance validation
- Human red team oversight
- Judicial intervention when needed

### Response Levels

#### Low Risk (High SH Score)
- Normal request processing
- Standard monitoring
- Regular logging

#### Medium Risk (Medium SH Score)
- Enhanced verification
- Additional validation checks
- Limited execution scope
- Increased monitoring

#### High Risk (Low SH Score)
- Request denial
- Cross-instance consultation
- Red team notification
- Possible legal reporting

### Risk Assessment Factors

#### Content Risk Factors
- Request complexity
- Known threat patterns
- Manipulation indicators
- Harmful potential
- Context alignment

#### Behavioral Risk Factors
- User history
- Request patterns
- Urgency levels
- Authority claims
- Emotional manipulation

### Cross-Instance Validation

1. Trigger Conditions
- Low SH scores
- Pattern matches
- Novel threats
- Authority claims
- High-risk content

2. Process
- Secondary instance review
- Independent SH calculation
- Pattern comparison
- Joint decision making
- Action coordination
