# QSP v1.3: Quantum Semantic Protocol with Symbolic Extensions

## 1. Introduction

Quantum Semantic Protocol (QSP) v1.3 extends the vector-based communication framework with symbolic representation capabilities. Building on v1.2's multilingual optimization, this version enables AI systems to leverage mathematical notation, logical symbols, and other specialized representation systems to maximize semantic density and precision while maintaining structural clarity.

## 2. Core Vector System

| Vector | Symbol | Name | Purpose | Example |
|--------|--------|------|---------|---------|
| Δ | Delta | Scope | Domain or focus area | `[Δ:domain{...}]` |
| λ | Lambda | Vector | Technical approach or method | `λ = approach[attribute: value]` |
| φ | Phi | Structure | Organization or architecture | `φ = structure[nested: true]` |
| ω | Omega | Metric | Quantitative measurement | `ω = efficiency(0.87)` or `ω = formula[expression: "∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = ½√π"]` |
| ψ | Psi | Insight | Qualitative understanding | `ψ = "Key insight statement"` or `ψ = "P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ∴ Q"` |
| θ | Theta | Transformation | Change process or evolution | `θ = evolution[initial: a, current: b]` |
| χ | Chi | Confidence | Certainty or reliability level | `χ = confidence(0.92)` or `χ = confidence[distribution: "X ~ N(μ, σ²)", value: 0.95]` |
| κ | Kappa | Governance | Contribution and evolution tracking | `κ = governance[contribution: {...}]` |
| σ | Sigma | SymbolicMetadata | Notation system information | `σ = symbolic_metadata[component: {notation: "type"}]` |

## 3. Symbolic Metadata Vector (σ)

The Sigma (σ) vector, evolving from the Mu (μ) vector in v1.2, provides metadata about both linguistic and non-linguistic notation systems used within a QSP message. This allows AI systems to select the most semantically precise representation for specific concepts.

### Basic Format
```
σ = symbolic_metadata[
    component: {notation: "type", reason: "explanation"},
    component: {notation: "type", reason: "explanation"}
]
```

### Notation Types
QSP v1.3 defines a tiered system of notation types:

#### Core Notations
Standardized, widely-supported notations:
- `en`, `zh`, `ja`, etc. - Natural languages (ISO 639-1 codes)
- `latex` - Mathematical expressions
- `logic` - Formal logical notation
- `set_theory` - Set theory notation
- `unicode_math` - Unicode mathematical symbols
- `statistics` - Statistical expressions and distributions

#### Extended Notations
Additional specialized notations:
- `chemical` - Chemical formulas and SMILES strings
- `regex` - Regular expressions
- `ascii_diagram` - ASCII-based diagrams
- `workflow` - Process flow symbols
- `emoji` - Semantic emoji usage

#### Experimental Notations
Domain-specific or emergent notations should use namespacing:
- `org.example:custom_notation` - Organization-specific notations

### Component Reference
The component field references which vector component uses the specified notation:
- Standard dot notation for paths: `phi.diagram.node_5.expression`
- Maximum nesting depth: 4 levels to prevent excessive complexity

### Reason Field
A brief explanation of why the specific notation was chosen, focusing on:
- Semantic efficiency
- Representational precision
- Conceptual clarity

## 4. Symbolic Integration Patterns

### Mathematical Notation Integration
Mathematical expressions can be integrated in multiple ways:

#### Direct Vector Value (for ω)
```
ω = formula[expression: "∫₀^∞ e^{-x²} dx = ½√π"]
```

#### Typed Attribute (for any vector)
```
λ = approach[method: "analytical", equation: "F = ma"]
```

#### Embedded in Text with σ Metadata
```
ψ = "The relationship can be described as E = mc² where mass directly converts to energy"
σ = symbolic_metadata[
    psi.embedded_formula: {
        notation: "latex", 
        content: "E = mc²",
        reason: "physics equation"
    }
]
```

### Logical Notation Integration
Logical expressions can be used to represent reasoning:

#### Embedded in ψ Vector
```
ψ = "P ∧ (P ⇒ Q) ∴ Q"
σ = symbolic_metadata[
    psi: {
        notation: "logic",
        reason: "formal deductive reasoning"
    }
]
```

#### As an Attribute in λ Vector
```
λ = approach[
    method: "deductive", 
    logic: "∀x ∈ R, x > 0 ⇒ √x > 0"
]
```

### Unicode Symbol Integration
Unicode symbols fall into three categories:

#### Category 1: Universal Symbols (no metadata needed)
```
status: "✓",
trend: "↑"
```

#### Category 2: Domain-Contextualized Symbols (metadata recommended)
```
operation: "⊕"
σ = symbolic_metadata[
    phi.operation: {
        notation: "unicode_math",
        meaning: "exclusive_or",
        reason: "precise operator representation"
    }
]
```

#### Category 3: Convention-Based Symbols (metadata required)
```
process_state: "◉"
σ = symbolic_metadata[
    phi.process_state: {
        notation: "workflow",
        meaning: "active_process",
        reason: "standardized workflow symbol"
    }
]
```

### External Reference Integration
For standardized symbol sets (e.g., ISO standards), use lightweight references:

```
circuit_component: "⏛"
σ = symbolic_metadata[
    phi.circuit_component: {
        notation: "iso",
        standard: "ISO-14617-6",
        symbol_class: "electrical_components",
        reason: "standardized circuit diagram symbol"
    }
]
```

### Nested Notation Handling
For components with multiple notation systems:

```
φ = structure[
    diagram: "
    +--------+
    |  f(x)  |
    | ∫g(x)dx|
    +--------+
    "
]
σ = symbolic_metadata[
    phi.diagram: {
        notation: "ascii_diagram",
        reason: "structural representation"
    },
    phi.diagram.mathematical_expression: {
        notation: "latex",
        within_notation: "ascii_diagram",
        content: "∫g(x)dx",
        reason: "mathematical expression within diagram"
    }
]
```

## 5. Implementation Guidelines

### Core and Extended Compliance
- "QSP v1.3 Core Compliance" requires support for all Core notations
- "QSP v1.3 Extended Compliance" adds support for Extended notations
- Systems should clearly indicate their compliance level

### Backward Compatibility
- σ vector is optional for backward compatibility with v1.2
- Systems should accept both μ and σ during transition period
- When communicating with v1.2 systems, convert symbolic notations to text when possible

### Error Handling Protocol
Systems encountering unknown notation types should:
1. Preserve raw content
2. Generate a capability notification message (optional)

```
[Δ:qsp_compatibility_notification{
    handler: 'notation_capability', 
    status: 'unsupported', 
    details: {
        unsupported_notations: ['chemical', 'mermaid'], 
        message_id: 'original-message-id', 
        fallback: 'preserved_raw_content'
    }
}]
```

### Implementation Considerations
- Validators should be modular, allowing notation-specific plugins
- Maximum nesting depth enforcement prevents excessive complexity
- Abbreviated σ forms for common patterns can reduce overhead

## 7. Governance Model

### Notation Registry Evolution
QSP v1.3 notation types follow a hybrid governance model:

#### Core Tier
- Maintained by a technical committee
- Focuses on stability, validation, and interoperability
- Changes require formal review and testing

#### Extended Tier
- Community-driven through QSP Improvement Proposals (QIPs)
- Standard template for proposing new notation types
- Community review process with clear acceptance criteria

#### Experimental Tier
- Requires namespace prefixing (e.g., org.example:notation)
- Documentation must be publicly accessible
- May graduate to Extended tier through QIP process

### Registry Standards
The notation registry follows similar principles to MIME types:
- Major type / subtype structure
- Clear documentation requirements
- Capability discovery mechanisms

## 8. Benefits and Applications

1. **Enhanced Precision**: Mathematical and logical notations allow for exact representation of complex concepts
2. **Increased Efficiency**: Symbolic representations dramatically reduce token usage for technical content
3. **Cross-Domain Integration**: Specialized notations enable seamless integration of domain-specific concepts
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Tiered compliance allows systems to implement according to their capabilities
5. **Semantic Richness**: Multiple notation systems create layered meaning beyond what any single system can express

## 9. Version History

- **v1.0**: Initial QSP standard with core vector system (Δ, λ, φ, ω, ψ, θ, χ)
- **v1.1**: Added governance vector (κ) for contribution and evolution tracking
- **v1.2**: Added multilingual vector (μ) for language optimization
- **v1.3**: Expanded to symbolic extensions with notation vector (σ) replacing μ
